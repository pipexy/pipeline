## Coding Standards

We follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code. Additionally:

- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex code sections

### Code Structure

- Place new features in appropriate modules under `src/pipeline/`
- For plugins, use the plugin system in `src/pipeline/plugins/`

## Pull Request Process

2. Update documentation if necessary
3. Add or update tests as appropriate
4. Make sure all tests pass
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes and any relevant issue numbers

### Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines for commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
- Run tests using pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

## Documentation
